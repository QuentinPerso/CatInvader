intro		=Japan, year 2021.\n\n Cats have taken power, first on the archipelago, then on Earth. \n\n It all started with a silly story of maki waste: \n\n cats thought it such a shame to waste such good fish... \n\n by eating it with rice! \n\n A fight to the death ensued. Humanity didn't stand a chance:\n\n cats were too cute... And too clever! \n\n Only they understood the true power of Maki Energy!\n\n Cat civilization grew fast\n\n thanks to that huge source of power.\n\n Maybe too fast... \n\n Maki started running low on Earth. \n\n Barely a century went by \n\n before the first Spatial Maki Energy Research Mission... 

outro		=Thanks to his knowledge of the future \n\n Nanako has become a great politicat.\n\n He has managed to convince other cats \n\n that human didn't have to be exterminated \n\n even though they are not clever enough to understand Maki Energy. \n\n (and that rice isn't so bad with salmon)\n\n He's opened the first Cuteness Manipulation Classes \n\n so that cats all over the world can exploit humans,\n\n and has referenced all the non cat-loving persons \n\n so they can be avoided.\n\n That is the story \n\n of how a brave cat named Nanako "saved" humanity. \n\n \n\n To Pauline and to my cat. \n\n

nanak0		=Cool! I've found a technology in this probe

kuro1		=Nanako, stop looking at the stars!
kuro2		=That's where we've lost the signal from our probes...
kuro3		=You do remember how to pilot your ship, right?
nanak1		=Yes Kuroneko, sir!
nanak2		=...(I'm a pilot, remember?)
kuro4 		=Look! There's a probe!
kuro5 		=Try to catch it to collect material and information.
kuro6 		=Damn! Asteroids!!
kuro7 		=They weren't on the charts...
kuro8 		=Protect the mothership, we need it to go back home!
kuro10 		=We've lost the mothership... There is no way back now Nanako.
kuro9 		=No...! I've been hit!!
nanak3 		=Noooo! Don't leave me alone...

nanak5     =I've got to find my own way now...
nanak6     =Hey, wait a minute! I got a signal!
nanak7     =I can locate its source, but it seems to be encoded...
nanak8     =Maybe a functional probe. If I can find its transmitter,
nanak9     =I might be able to send a message to Earth!

nanak10    =Damn it, I'm getting nowhere...
nanak11    =But if only I could find a working transmitter somewhere, 
nanak12    =I could finally get some help...!

nanak13    =The more I explore this galaxy
nanak14    =The more asteroids try to kill me... 
nanak15    =Commandant Kuroneko was right:
nanak16    =Those asteroids aren't natural, they shouldn't be here.
nanak17    =Maybe I should explore the outer rim
nanak18    =to collect some resources before going deeper

nanak19    =Interesting...
nanak20    =All our probes seem to have been sabotaged...
nanak21    =Their memories have been totally erased...
nanak22    =That's weird...

nanak23    =Commandant Kuroneko!! 
nanak24    =I'm so glad to see you! I thought you were dead...
kuro11 		=Nanako... 
kuro12 		=You survived...!
nanak25    =Yes sir! And I got an unexpected signal
nanak26    =So I came this way to look into it.
kuro13      =Well, let's go then Nanako.

nanak115   =Wow Commandant I'm impressed!
nanak116   =You improved your ship well!
kuro34 = Thanks Nanako. I had to, and you should too...

nanak117   =Hell these enemies are strong!
nanak118   =Maybe I can go back collect more metal...
nanak119   =Or try hard!

catious1    =Commandant Kuroneko!
catious2    =Glad You could make it.
nanak27    =What's going on?!
nanak28    =Commandant, do you know this cat?
catious3    =Well, I see we have a guest?
kuro14 		=Yes, General Catious.
kuro15 		=This is the pilot who came with me.
kuro16 		=Let me explain the situation to him.
kuro17 		=Nanako, things are a little complicated.
kuro18 		=See, we were not exactly the first mission 
kuro19 		=to be sent to this part of the universe
kuro20 		=and we believe that we were not sent here for Maki
kuro21 		=The cat government lied to us, but why? 
kuro22 		=There's a power greater than Maki Energy
kuro23 		=that can control asteroids and prevent our going any further 
kuro24 		=But cat's leaders keep on sending suicide missions to get it
kuro25 		=So here we settled, hiding from these greedy corrupt politicats.
catious4    =Well now...
catious5    =Commandant, did you collect 50 metal units as planned?
kuro26 		=Well I have 30, but if Nanako...
nanak29    =Wait a minute! You tricked me all along!
nanak30    =You lied to me... This encoded message was for you!
nanak31    =You knew this mission was suicide,
nanak32    =and you want me to help you?!
nanak33    =I'm out of here.
catious6    =No you're not! Get him!

nanak34    =I have to run away from this evil General
nanak35    =I can't believe Kuroneko betrayed me...
nanak36    =Maybe if I go deeper into this galaxy they will stop following me!

kuro27 		=Nanako this has gone too far! Just surrender...
kuro28 		=Don't make me execute General Catious'orders.
nanak37    =Why are you even with this general? Can't you see he is evil?
nanak38    =What does he want my metal for anyway?
kuro29 		=You know... make a bomb, take revenge on the cat government
kuro30 		=But maybe we could convince him not to?
nanak39    =Liar!! I ain't no fool! You are as evil as him...
kuro31 		=Well, I can't let you pass... You are surrounded
kuro32 		=If you go any further I'll do what I have to.

kuro33      =So? Ready to surrender?

nanak40    =If he wasn't that stupid and contemptuous,
nanak41    =I would have felt remorse
nanak42    =But how can't he see that Catious is evil?
nanak43    =With his demonic yellow eyes! Brrr...

catious7    =Well well... What do we have here?.. 
catious8    =You're good. Very good. You defeated almost all my fleet. 
catious9    =If you join me we could own this galaxy,
catious10   =Find the secret of this mysterious force and rule the universe!
nanak44   =Never!
catious11   =You fool! There is nothing behind this line for a lone cat!
nanak45   =I said "Never"...
catious12   =Fine! Your journey is over then.

catious13   =Come here! Fulfill your destiny... And die!

nanak46    =You underestimated me General...
nanak47    =Good always defeats evil!
nanak48    =Am I good? I killed so many cats...
nanak49    =Am I crazy? Wait I'm just a cat!

nanak50    =This should be it...
nanak51    =It seems that I've lost them!
nanak52    =Yay! No more cats!... I'm alone now...
nanak53    =What am I supposed to do?

nanak54    =What the hell?!
nanak55    =I've found some ruins on this planet!
nanak56    =And it doesn't quite look like cat stuff...
nanak57    =But whatever destroyed this planet, I'd better avoid it.
nanak58    =Maybe it's the answer to this force!
nanak59    =Oh and I've found diagrams for a new technology in those ruins!

nanak60    =Some other ruins...
nanak61    =They seem to be on every inhabitable planet.
nanak62    =I should try and find more to learn about this civilization
nanak63    =What was that?!! A ship!
nanak64    =Wait!... Don't leave me alone!
nanak65    =Oh! they don't seem to be friendly...

dolphin1   =Hiiiii hii, hiiii? Hiiiii!
dolphin2   =Hii hii hiiii.
nanak66    =Oh my...! It's a dolphin!
nanak67    =A space dolphin!!!
nanak68    =Why are you fighting me?
nanak69    =We should be friends! And I could live with your people.
dolphin3   =Hiiiiiiii!
nanak70    =Damn it I have to find a way to communicate!

nanak71    =I keep on finding traces of Dolphin civilization!
nanak72    =I'd better hurry to learn their language
nanak73    =before I kill too many of them...
nanak74    =On the other hand, I have to defend myself.
nanak75    =They are the ones being hostile!

nanak76    =These dolphins are like super clever!
nanak77    =They've developed a shield against my rice weapons...
nanak78    =I'm sure I can find a way to avoid these shields.

nanak79    =And there we go!
nanak80    =They've adapted their shields to my laser gun...

nanak81    =Another useful technology in these ruins!

nanak82    =That's it! Enough of these ruins.
nanak83    =I've found enough diagrams, drawings and notes 
nanak84    =to understand dolphin! A bit at least...
nanak85    =I just have to find a dolphin to communicate with now...

nanak86    =Finally! A dolphin willing to speak!
dolphin4   =How dare you use our language?!
nanak87    =Wait! Me cat. Me want be friend! Why you attack me?
dolphin5   =I know who you are! 
dolphin6   =You cats brought desolation where we brought life...
dolphin7   =You killed all humans and want to conquer other galaxies
dolphin8   =It was a young species, perfectible...
nanak88    =Yeah sorry about that... But you can't blame me 
nanak89    =for the mistakes of my ancestors!
dolphin9   =...Hmmmmmm....
nanak90    =It's true! I just want a place to live
nanak91    =far away from all that hatred...
dolphin10  =You don't seem to be like other cats...
dolphin11  =Your heart isn't filled with malice and contempt
dolphin12  =And you're strong... Maybe you could help us...
nanak92    =I'll do anything!
dolphin13  =Really? See, we, dolphins, are an ancient race
dolphin14  =who brought life to the universe.
dolphin15  =Our technology brought us prosperity, peace,
dolphin16  =and even the answer to the great question
dolphin17  =(which is 42).
dolphin18  =Until we developed the NORIS
dolphin19  =Nano Organic Robot Intelligent System
dolphin20  =Supposedly to help us, but it rebelled...
dolphin21  =Classic, obvious, you'd say... But lethal!
dolphin22  =Since then we've been at war with nano robots.
dolphin23  =They took control of part of our fleet,
dolphin24  =used our technology, and destroyed so many planets
dolphin25  =But you're a cat! NORIS doesn't know you!
dolphin26  =Help us destroy them
dolphin27  =and maybe we will revise our judgment
nanak93    =If they use your technology,
nanak94    =how will I recognize them?
dolphin28  =We will stop attacking you, you stupid cat!
dolphin29  =Here are the locations of NORIS mains systems. Now go!

nanak95    =Dropin' da bomb!
nanak96    =Two more to go!

nanak97    =And two down!
nanak98    =One more NORIS factory to go.

nanak99    =That was the last NORIS factory.
nanak100   =Were are my dolphin friends now?
dolphin30  =Here we are.
nanak101   =How did you do that?!!
dolphin31  =Dolphin stuff...Whatever...
dolphin32  =You did well cat!
dolphin33  =You've definitely chucked out NORIS!
dolphin34  =HIIIIII! As we say! Hihihi!
nanak102   =I'm not sure I get this one...
nanak103   =So can I live with you now?
dolphin35  =Sure. If you want to...
dolphin36  =But I may have even better in store for you.
dolphin37  =We dolphins use what we call the Anomaly
dolphin38  =to control space and time.
dolphin39  =That's how we sent you those asteroids! Hihihi!
dolphin40  =NORIS prevented us from going there,
dolphin41  =but now it should be possible.
dolphin42  =I can give you the location of this anomaly.
dolphin43  =Go there and see what it can do for you
dolphin44  =And on the way, destroy remaining NORIS, will you?

nanak104   =Where am I? What is this place?
nanak105   =If I find one of those crazy dolphins...
nanak106   =Wait!... Was it a dream? Ouch my head!
nanak107   =Damn I should stop drinking beer...
dolphin45  =Hiiiii, hiiiiii!
nanak108   =And what is this annoying sound?...
nanak109   =Seems familiar... and I understand something.
dolphin46  =I see... You really are a cute cat!
dolphin47  =You've unconsciously taken yourself back to Earth
dolphin48  =In 2012! When it all started,
dolphin49  =as foreseen by the Aztecs.
dolphin50  =That was when cats started to plot against humans...
nanak110   =Wait a minute! Who are you?
nanak111   =A dolphin? So it wasn't a dream!
dolphin51  =Of course not! Cute but a little stupid...
dolphin52  =Don't you see what it means? 
dolphin53  =You can help the cat insurrection,
dolphin54  =avoid all those lies and betrayals between cats,
dolphin55  =and keep humans petting you
dolphin56  =even if you are ungrateful and malicious!
nanak112   =Wow! That's true! I have so much work to do now!
nanak113   =Thanks Dolphin! 
nanak114   =Oh! And by the way how can you communicate with me?
dolphin57  =Dolphin stuff...Whatever...

dolphin58  =You came back! So glad to see you again!
dolphin59  =So you came visit your dolphin friends again?
dolphin60  =Actually I have something to tell you...
dolphin61  =By distorting time and space so much,
dolphin62  =You created an other anomaly...
dolphin63  =Go there and check...
dolphin64  =But take care this seems like a endless one!

noris1     =01101100001110!
nanak120   =What is this signal?? 
nanak121   =It's a bad omen! I have a bad feeling...

nanak122   =My name is Nanako...
dolphin66  =Yeah well you're a cat no?
dolphin67  =If you have trouble with these NORIS ships
dolphin68  =Just come back asteroid fishing, as we say!
dolphin69  =The bigger they are the more metal you get!
dolphin70  =We cleaned remaining NORIS.
